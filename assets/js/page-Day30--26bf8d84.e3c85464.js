I am happy to say that I think that I am finally catching onto what we are doing. I feel like Vue has really helped me solidify what we are doing. I understand how we did things before, but I always got lost or confused. Vue with its rules and its simplicity has helped me a lot to be able to say 'This is how this works and everything kind of goes together for each little part.' I am really starting to enjoy building things, even when I start to struggle with problems that arise. I am still concerned because I think I struggle being on my own a lot. Like I ask questions when I am in class, and when we are in lab, but I really struggle to reach out and bother people on the weekend. I also need to spend more time at home working on things. I need to get it out of my head that when I am home I am off of work. If things need to get done, and I need to learn, then I just need to do them. I need to stop procrastinating or feeling bad for myself.\nOther than those things that I am struggling with I have enjoyed this week in class the most by far.
