I fell behind last week, but this week coming back I have redoubled my efforts with all of my classwork. I feel good about understanding how the applications talk with the APIs and the servers. I still know that I do not know a whole lot, but I am willing to learn everything that I need to. There have been very frustrating moments, but I think I am starting to have a couple of things click in my learning. I am shocked too that we are already about a third of the way done with the course and I am really sad to see the senior class go here within the next week or so.\nThis journey has been hard, and exhausting, but I think that I am finally at a point where I feel more comfortable with the speed of the class and everything. Do not get me wrong, this class is crazy fast and I feel like I am white knuckling it the whole time, but I think that I might be acclimating to the whole situation. I probably say that now and I am going to regret saying that because next week will be just as much of a roller coaster if not more. I am scared and nervous for the rest of the course too, I know that we have some very busy weeks coming up. So far though, I have really enjoyed the class. I really like the people and I really like the staff. Everyone is so good to me. I am sad to see some of our classmates drop the class this week though. I know life happens, but it was hard to know that our numbers have dwindled just a bit. I want to do better than they did. I want to make this a success in my life. I want to start building and solving these puzzles. I want to become an expert coder. I would love to teach people the way that the staff at Boise Codeworks teach peopole. I think I really enjoy helping people and helping people to learn.\nI am apprehensive of what the future holds, and I know that the journey is going to be tough, but I really have started to belive that this whole hard, sometimes sucky, journey is going to help me find some purpose in life.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Thank you to all of the staff at BoiseCodeworks.
