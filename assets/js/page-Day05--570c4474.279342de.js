There have been a few times where I have wanted to panic and just curl up into a ball because the course was not easy or because I felt like I was not understanding a certain concept. This week I have learned a ton, I know that I can accomplish this cours. It may not be very easy, but I am enjoying the progress that I am seeing in myself from even just one week of learning at Boise Codeworks. The people are wonderful and fun, and they make learning easy, enjoyable, and fulfilling. The pre-course work was exceptionally challenging and it was incredibly hard learning on my own, but having the class time to really start learning by doing has made learning how to code infinitely better for me.\nI am feeling fairly confident with what we have learned this week, so far a good majority of it makes sense. I do not have all of the knowledge necesary to be able to be comfortable enough to set up a website all by myself, however I have learned a lot in this first week. This course is doable, it may not be fun all the time, it may frustrate the hell out of me sometimes, but I am going to give this course my all and by the end of it I will have a new skill that will help me jettison myself into a career field where I will be able to work indefinately.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("I would like to thank all of the teachers and employees at CodeWorks at this time.
